	}

/*
 steps 2 :  Extablished the Connection
 
 1.  in jdbc we can help of Connection interface to extablish the connection.
 2.  In jdbc to Extablish the Connection between java Application and Database 
     we need a Connection Object but It is interface we cannot create object.
     so we can take help of helper class called DriverManager.
     
     DriverManager are provide static method are called as getConnection("String url","String uname","String password");
     getConnection method internally validate the passed url, uname, and password with the database.
     
     if Credentials (url, uname, password) is correct the getConnection return the object of Connection.
     else it will return throws error SQLException.
     
 ***Note*** : Connection interface is also callec as Factory interface.
               because it provide of another interface such as statement , preparedStatement.
